# Dextego Intern Challenge

## Fixes Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1.Fixed all critical bugs that were preventing the application from running. 
- Fixed invalid JSON format.  
- Added missing commas.  
- Removed trailing commas.  
- Ensured all values are valid (e.g., `"duration": 900` as a number, not a string).

**Bug:**  
The issue was that `totalCalls` was undefined.  

**Fix:**  
```<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">{stats.totalCalls}</p> ```

Text on the dashboard includes Total Calls, Call Duration, and Active Users, each accompanied by numerical values. The overall tone is professional and organized, supporting efficient data review in a business environment.
